				Happy House was built in 1947 by Beth’s grandfather, Jack
Hayne Davis — a farmer who worked the surrounding land all of
his life except for his very short career as a lawyer. Jack Davis
and his beloved wife, Dolly, had five children before they divorced.
Mental illness consumed Dolly in her mid and later life and when
she insisted on leaving their marriage, Jack relinquished the
house to her and his remaining children and moved one-half mile
away. He carried on with a dignity and sense of humor rivaled by
none, farming and taking in lost animals, and charming his
grandchildren with his love of land and nature. Much later in life,
and after her second husband died, Jack and Dolly reunited.
Two of their children are alive today, as are seven grandchildren,
eight great-grandchildren, and one great, great grandson. Over
the years, the well-built and beautifully restored house has
become a happy home. Before your arrival, Happy House was a
peaceful residence for many young Presbyterian coaches,
pharmacy students, and nurses. Beth and Steve opened their
doors as a Bed and Bath in 2018.
